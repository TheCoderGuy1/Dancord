# Dancord
So you have found my open-source version of Dancord. This version is specially made for people that want to self-host my bot.

# What do I need?
You will need this awesome thing called node.js, but even more important the thing that makes this really work (many thanks to this guy) you will need discord.js.
You can get that @ www.github.com/danielgraycode/discord.js
If you look up simple tutorials on google they will come to you, or ask me at info@danielgray.me

# Other important stuff
It would be lovely if you could provide some credit, even if you just keep my website in the credits command I will be happy :)

Enjoy!
